# IntroToSE_5781_N-Y
A project about computer graphics that I and Yishaya Zobel made on our fourth year in JCT.
This project is used to render geometries in a scene.
Simply, you place the geometries, the camera and the light sources, and the program will render it to an image.
There are also some great features, like anti-aliasing (smooth the edges of the geometry in the picture) and depth of field (blur the things that aren't in focus.
